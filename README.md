eKYC using Blockchain Technology

Submission for KJSCE HackIT at TECHNEXT 2019

Problem Definition:

To collect the document from user for KYC verification and store the documents in BlockChain using IPFS and then store the hash key generated by IPFS in the blockchain. Further this blockchain containing the documents can be used by other institutions for doing KYC of respective client by just requesting access for documents from client without asking them to upload same thing again and again. 

Implementation:

ReactJs is used for the front-end development. After that using the concept of smart contract and IPFS the blockchain containing the information of the client in terms of hash key of its document is stored.
